The changes below form the bulk of what is new in the Gelato release of
GroupServer [#GelatoTickets]_. Work is now progressing on GroupServer
10.11 — Kulfi Craved while Caving [#KulfiTickets]_.

New Group Homepage
==================

The homepage used by groups has had a major redesign [#GroupHome]_. Now
it is divided into multiple tabs. This allows for information to be
better organized, and more easily found. Overall the look is cleaner,
and the page is easier to use.

Better Bouncing
===============

Sometimes an email to a group member will not get through, and the
message bounces.  GroupServer has always recorded these bounces. Now
this information is presented to the group administrator, who can see a
log of failed attempts to send the member an email message [#Bouncing]_.

Resend Invitation
=================

The group administrator now has the option of resending an invitation 
that did not get through to the new group member [#ResendInvite]_. There
have been many other minor improvements to the invitation system thanks
to the feedback from the users of `OnlineGroups.Net`_.

Notification Updates
====================

The email notifications that are sent out by GroupServer in response to
an event have been given a through update. They are now clearer and
contain more useful information than before [#Notifications]_.

New Favicon
===========

GroupServer now has a new multi-resolution favicon, which is shown in
the location bar of the browser [#Favicon]_.
 
New Help System
===============

The user manual and administration manuals are out of date and in
need of work. To help with this a new help system has been introduced
[#Manual]_. It allows for sections of the manuals to be more easily
maintained, which will hopefully allow for better manuals in the future.

Switch to Zope 2.13 Beta
========================

GroupServer now runs on the the latest version of `Zope 2`_. The new
features in Zope are used for the `new group homepage`_, and the `new
help system`_.
