We wrote this documentation for people with moderate experience in
Linux system administration. Installation can be tricky: you have to
configure at least email sending, the web interface, and persistent
storage. All these systems must work or installation will fail.

If you get stuck, please ask us questions in `GroupServer
Development`_. Other more detailed guides would be gratefully accepted.

.. _GroupServer Development: http://groupserver.org/groups/development

Quick Start
===========

#.  Install the required packages (see `Requirements`_).
#.  Download the latest version of GroupServer from 
    <http://groupserver.org/downloads> and extract the archive
    (see `Download`_).
#.  Create a new hostname for your GroupServer site. Yes, you will need 
    a new one (see `Pick a Host Name`_).
#.  Edit ``config.cfg`` (see `Configure GroupServer`_).
#.  Enable prepared transaction support in PostgreSQL (see `Configure
    PostgreSQL`_).
#.  Run the following (see `Run the Installer`_)::

      $ ./gs_install_ubuntu.sh

#.  `Start Zope`_::

      $ ./bin/instance fg

#.  Visit your new site.

Later you can further configure the `Email Server`_ and add an optional
`Web Proxy`_.

You can `remove GroupServer`_ in three steps.

Requirements
============

GroupServer is developed on `Ubuntu`_, and is know to run on
`CentOS`_. We will gladly accept any modifications you have that will
make GroupServer run on more platforms.

Below the packages that are required to install GroupServer are listed
for Ubuntu, CentOS, and RedHat Enterprise Linux.

The installation script for Ubuntu will install all the above libraries
(see `Run the Installer`_).

Download
========

GroupServer is distributed as a tar-file. To download the latest
version of GroupServer visit <http://groupserver.org/downloads> and
click ``Download``. You must then extract GroupServer from the tar-file
into a directory such as ``/opt``, ``/home`` or ``/usr/local``.

When the tar-file is extracted a new directory will be made.
This directory contains the configuration files for GroupServer.
In addition, the installation process will download and install
some dependencies into the directory (see `Run the Installer`_). 
Finally, GroupServer will be run from the same directory (see `Start 
Zope`_).

:Note: You may need to be the ``root`` user to extract the archive. If you
       do then you must change the ownership of the new GroupServer
       directory and all of its contents. GroupServer can only be run by
       users with normal privileges.

Set Up
======

Setting up GroupServer is done in four steps: first `pick a host name`_,
then `configure GroupServer`_, `run the Installer`_ to install the 
system, and finally `start Zope`_.

Pick a Host Name
----------------

Your new site needs its own hostname. The name needs to be known to
the *web browser* that you will use to access the site. It will pass
the name to the Zope system that runs GroupServer. (Zope can serve
multiple sites, as well as its web-based management system.) For a trial
system, the name can be set up in the ``hosts(5)`` file.

* Edit ``/etc/hosts`` as ``root``.
* Add the new host name to the ``localhost`` entry, which is normally
  the first one. For example, to add the name ``gstest`` change the
  line to the following::

    127.0.0.1    localhost gstest

* Save the ``hosts`` file.

Configure GroupServer
---------------------

The configuration of GroupServer is mostly carried out by modifying the
``config.cfg`` file, which is located in the root of the GroupServer 
folder [#cfgFile]_. First you must configure the `GroupServer Site`_
itself. Next the `Zope`_ system, which will run your GroupServer site, 
needs to be configured, before the `database storage`_.

GroupServer Site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to check all the configuration for your initial site. In
particular the email addresses for your first two users **must** be set.

``host``
  The domain name used by your new GroupServer instance. It must be the
  same as what you picked a host name earlier (see `Pick a Host Name`_).

``port``
  The port that your new GroupServer instance will run on. By default it is
  ``8080``, which is the same as the ``zope_port``. To run on any other
  port you will need to set up a `web proxy`_.

``admin_email``
  When GroupServer is installed, an example site and group are created. So
  you can use the administration functions you must log in as an
  administrator. This is the email address of that administrator. Posts to
  the example group will be sent to the administrator at this address. This
  email address **must** work.
  
``admin_password``
  The password of the administrator of the new GroupServer site. The
  password will be used to log in, and can be changed after the site has
  been created.

  
``user_email``
  The email address of the normal user that is created along with the new
  GroupServer site. The normal user is a member of the same group as the
  administrator, but the user has no permission to alter the site. Posts to
  the example group will be sent to the user at this address. In addition,
  this email address will be used to log in to the new site.  The email
  address for the normal user **must** be different to the email address
  for the administrator, and the email address **must** work.

``user_password``
  The password for the normal user of the new GroupServer site. The
  password will be used to log in, and can be changed after the site has
  been created.

``support_email``
  The email address where support messages are sent, and were email
  notifications are send from. For testing this can be set to your own
  email address.

``smtp_host``
  The SMTP host that will be used to send notifications from
  GroupServer. It defaults to ``localhost``, assuming you will be running a
  local SMTP server.

Zope
~~~~

Your site will run on the Zope_ system. This system must also be
configured. The default values for ``zope_host`` and ``zope_port`` are
probably correct. However, for security we recommend you change the name
and password of the Zope administrator.

``zope_host``
  The host that will run Zope. It defaults to the local machine.
  
``zope_port``
  The IP port that Zope will listen to. It defaults to 8080. Zope will have
  to run as ``root`` to use port 80, and this is discouraged.
  
``zope_admin``
  The name of the user who will administer Zope.
  
``zope_password``
  The password for the Zope administrator. It can (and should) be changed
  after GroupServer has been set up.

Database Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GroupServer stores most of its data in PostgreSQL. Two passwords need to be
set by you to protect this data.

``pgsql_password``
  The password required to attach to the PostgreSQL database. The install
  system will create a PostgreSQL database, and protect it with this
  ``pgsql_password``.
  
``relstorage_password``
  `The RelStorage system`_ will store data in a PostgreSQL database for
  Zope. This data is protected by the ``relstorage_password``.

.. _the RelStorage system: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RelStorage

Configure PostgreSQL
--------------------

`The RelStorage system`_ that is used by GroupServer requires *prepared
transaction* support to be enabled in PostgreSQL. To enable prepared
transaction support carry out the following steps.

#. Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file. On Ubuntu you must be ``root``
   to edit this file, which is located at
   ``/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf``.

#. Find the line that reads::

     max_prepared_transactions = 0

#. Change the line to read::

     max_prepared_transactions = 1

#. Restart PostgreSQL. On Ubuntu this is done using the following command::

     $ sudo service postgresql restart

Run the Installer
-----------------

The installer is a Bash script. To run the GroupServer installer enter the
following command::

  $ ./gs_install_ubuntu.sh

You will be prompted for your password. This is required to check that your
Ubuntu system has met all the `requirements`_. Next the installer ensures
that the `set up`_ is correct.

The rest of the installation process should be completely automatic. The
system will create a *sandbox* for your GroupServer site, with its own
version of Python, placed in ``./bin/``. It will then configure the
PostgreSQL databases that store the data for your site. Finally, it will
start the `buildout`_ system that will **download** and install all the
requirements for GroupServer (around 32MB of packages) including:
  
* `eGenix.com mx Base`_ (4.4MB)
* `SQL Alchemy`_ (2.6MB)
* jQuery_ (1.9MB)
* `Zope 2.13`_ (1.4MB)
* feedparser_ (1.2MB)

.. _eGenix.com mx Base: http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxBase
.. _SQL Alchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
.. _jQuery: https://source.iopen.net/groupserver/gs.content.js.jquery/summary
.. _Zope 2.13: http://docs.zope.org/zope2/releases/2.13/
.. _feedparser: http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/

:Note: You need a functioning network connection to download the packages.

It is a good idea to make a cup of coffee, or go to lunch, while buildout
processes.

CentOS and RHEL Buildout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process to install GroupServer on CentOS or RedHat Enterprise Linux is
manual. The basic idea is as follows, but it lacks testing.

:Note: Commands that have to be run as ``root`` are shown on lines that
       begin with a ``#``. Commands that must be run as a normal user are
       shown on lines that begin with a ``$``.

#. Install the requirements_.

#. Create the two database users specified in ``config.cfg``, using
   ``createuser``::

     # createuser -D -S -R -l gsadmin
     # createuser -D -S -R -l gszodbadmin

#. Create the two databases specified in ``config.cfg`` using
   ``createdb``::

     # createdb -Ttemplate0 -O gsadmin -EUTF-8 groupserver
     # createdb -Ttemplate0 -O gszodbadmin -EUTF-8 groupserverzodb

#. Get the Python ``virtualenv`` package::

     # easy_install virtualenv

#. Set up a virtual Python environment for GroupServer::

     $ virtualenv --no-site-packages .

#. Grab the ``argparse`` module::

     $ ./bin/easy_install argparse==1.1

#. Fetch the system that builds GroupServer::

     $ ./bin/easy_install zc.buildout==1.5.2

#. Run the ``buildout`` process::

     $ ./bin/buildout -N

Start Zope
----------

Your GroupServer site is supported by Zope. To start the Zope run the
following command::

  $ ./bin/instance fg

Zope will have started when the message ``Zope Ready to handle requests``
is displayed in the terminal.

You should be able to view your GroupServer site at
`http://{host}:{zope_port}`. If you kept the defaults, the address will be
<http://gstest:8080>.
  
* The host is the one you picked earlier (see `Pick a Host Name`_).
* The port is the one that site listens to (see `Configure GroupServer`_).

Use ``Control-c`` to stop Zope.

Running Zope as a Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may be more convenient to run Zope in the background, as a daemon. To
run Zope as a daemon run the following command::

  $ ./bin/instance start

To stop the daemon run::

  $ ./bin/instance stop
    
Email Server
============

Postfix provides the email interface for GroupServer. Configuring Postfix
is tricky, and is optional: you can use the Web interface to GroupServer
without configuring the email server.  However, GroupServer uses Postfix
to:

* Queue email that is delivered to groups, and
* Pass the email messages to GroupServer.

If you are new to administering Postfix you may find the `Ubuntu Community
Postfix Documentation`_ useful.

.. _Ubuntu Community Postfix Documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix

Postfix has to know to run two scripts when email messages come in for your
GroupServer site. To do this you will have to change some files in the
Postfix configuration directory. For Ubuntu this directory is
``/etc/postfix``.

:Note: Commands that have to be run as ``root`` are shown on lines that
       begin with a ``#``. Commands that can be run as a normal user are
       shown on lines that begin with a ``$``.

Copy the Configuration Files
----------------------------

* Copy the files ``postfix_config/groupserver.*`` from the GroupServer
  installation directory to the Postfix configuration directory
  ``/etc/postfix``.
* Change the ownership of the files to the Postfix user and group. For
  Ubuntu this would be::
  
    # chown nobody.nogroup /etc/postfix/groupserver.*

  If you are on a system other than Ubuntu, running the following
  will display the user-name of the Postfix user::
  
    $ /usr/sbin/postconf | grep default_privs | cut -f3 -d" "
* Modify the host

Change ``main.cf``
------------------

* Edit ``/etc/postfix/main.cf``.
* Find the ``alias_maps`` parameter.
* Add the following on a line below the existing value of
  ``alias_maps``::

    hash:/etc/postfix/groupserver.aliases

* Find the ``virtual_alias_maps`` parameter.
* Add the following on a line below the existing value of 
  ``virtual_alias_maps`` ::

    hash:/etc/postfix/groupserver.virtual     

* Find the ``mydestination`` parameter.
* If the hostname specified as ``virtual`` in the
  ``/etc/postfix/groupserver.virtual`` is listed as a destination,
  it will need to be removed from ``mydestination`` as it cannot be
  specified in both places.
* Add the following to the bottom, unless it is previously defined::

    smtpd_authorized_verp_clients = 127.0.0.1


Update Postfix
--------------

To load the new configuration into Postfix run the following commands::

    # postalias /etc/postfix/groupserver.aliases
    # postmap /etc/postfix/groupserver.virtual
    # postfix reload


Web Proxy
=========

A web proxy is unnecessary if you only wish to try GroupServer. However,
for production sites it is a good idea to run a proxy to provide the
following services:

* To mediate between the low level HTTP port (port 80) and the 
  high-port that Zope runs on (normally port 8080, see `Configure
  GroupServer`_).
* To rewrite the URL to include a skin directive.
* To rewrite the URL to support virtual hosting.
* To provide caching.

GroupServer is known to work with many Web proxies including Varnish,
``NGINX``, ``ha_proxy``, and Apache. For Apache a rewrite rule that is
required to provide the mapping looks like the one in the example file
``apache-groupserver``.

Remove Groupserver
==================

To remove GroupServer, you must remove the database, the associated
database user, and the directory that contains the GroupServer install.

1. To remove the database, run the following commands::
  
    $ dropdb gstestdb -U postgres
    $ dropuser gstest -U postgres

  ``gstestdb``
    The name of the test database.
    
  ``postgres``
    The name of the admin of PostgreSQL.
    
  ``gstest``
    The name of the PostgreSQL user.

2. Remove the directory that contains the GroupServer install::

    $ rm -r groupserver-12.11
