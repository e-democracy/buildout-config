The Pineapple Snow release of GroupServer contains four main enhancements
and corrections [#PineappleSnowTickets]_.

* There is an `Updated Change Email Settings Page`_.
* Searching will now search the topic and post titles [#Search]_.
* An *Edit this page* link is sometimes shown to logged out users on
  editable pages [#Edit]_.
* The *Accept Invitation* page looks a lot better [#Accept]_.

You can `get Pineapple Snow`_ immediately. Work is now starting on
GroupServer 11.04 — Slushy followed by a Pounding Headache [#Slushy]_.

Updated Change Email Settings Page
==================================

The Change Email Settings page has had an extensive redesign
[#Redesign]_. Email addresses can be dragged from one list to another
in order to characterise them. The old interface relied on menus and
multiple buttons, and was far harder to use. In addition the new
interface automatically updates when an email address is verified
[#Verify]_.

The new interface uses the jQuery UI JavaScript library, just like the
group homepage. jQuery UI is an excellent library builds on the already
great jQuery library [#jQuery]_.

Get Pineapple Snow
==================

To get Pineapple Snow go to `the Downloads page for GroupServer
<http://groupserver.org/downloads>`_ and follow `the GroupServer
Installation documentation <http://groupserver.org/downloads/install>`_.

Those who already have a functioning installation can `update an existing
