The Baked Alaska release of GroupServer mostly consists of changes to
the email verification system [#BakedAlaskaTickets]_.

* Error handling is improved. Following an old verification link will
  show a suggestion to view your profile, rather than an Unexpected
  Error page. In addition the corner cases of a missing verification
  ID and broken ID are handled.
* The Verification page now more closely conforms to Web standards.
* The verification code (``gs.profile.email.verify``) is now easier to
  understand and extend.

In addition the site homepage has been modified. Now the groups and
profile image of a logged in user are shown. This should make groups
easier to find.

Work is now starting on GroupServer 11.02 — Tartufo Nibbled in Polite
Company [#TartufoTickets]_.
