The Tartufo release of GroupServer mostly consists of enhancements so
errors are handled better [#TartufoTickets]_.

* A new *Unexpected Error* page provides more detail to the user.
  In addition, the pre-written message to support contains a full
  stack-trace. This information can be used to find and eliminate the
  error [#UnexpectedError]_.
* Many errors were generated when non-existent pages were accessed. 
  These errors have been fixed, primarily in the mailing-list
  code. This should make problems recorded in the error-log maintained
  by Zope easier to find, as there should be fewer items in the log
  [#Traversal]_.
* Changes to email addresses are now better recorded [#EmailAudit]_.
  This should help diagnose problems better if there is an error
  subsequent to an address changing.
* The jQuery code shipped with GroupServer has been updated to the
  latest stable version (1.4.4).
* The code that generates the image, post, and topic pages has been
  refactored. This should make those pages easier to maintain.
  
Work is now starting on GroupServer 11.03 — Pineapple Snow at a
Child's Party [#PineappleSnowTickets]_.
